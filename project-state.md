## Current truth

- The repository is a local clone of `link2004/novim` at upstream tag `v0.1.7`
  and commit `8e36d447ee9c73d29b75f3dfc50db9452a2addf1`.
- The clone lives at `/Users/mert/novim-custom`; `origin` points to the
  personal fork `medonmez/novim-custom` and `upstream` points to the official
  `link2004/novim` repository.
- The installed `novim` release remains independent and is not being edited.
- Workflow manifests and durable project records have been bootstrapped under
  `docs/` without removing or duplicating the upstream public documentation.
- `TASK-001` was locally reviewed (`APPROVED` at candidate `b8512b6`) and
  delivered through GitHub PR #1. Merge commit
  `12327b78049e1348df858b589baf669ba451c090` is present on `origin/main`; all
  7 acceptance criteria passed local validation.
- Product direction is now accepted for planning: a VS Code-like, two-pane,
  mouse-resizable, read-only Git diff workbench with a settings surface for
  dot-folder visibility and no plugin dependency.
- `TASK-003` was locally reviewed `APPROVED`, delivered through GitHub PR #3,
  and verified in merge commit `6a9be23522c43110dd4c4053f67ab22c8586d4b9` on
  `origin/main`. The project browser hides dot-prefixed entries by default,
  persists the visibility setting under isolated state, filters directory
  previews consistently, and surfaces settings-write failures.
- `TASK-004` was locally reviewed `APPROVED`, delivered through GitHub PR #4,
  and verified in merge commit `cdb9140947f0fe4beb9a4748e599e8f769fb6aec` on
  `origin/main`. The workbench opens regular project files in the right editor
  pane, preserves read-only directory and Git inspection, supports bidirectional
  Files/Git Diff navigation, and retains unsaved source buffers during preview
  navigation.
- `TASK-005` was locally reviewed `APPROVED` at candidate
  `965b25cab4195f8b12fb7880971741c48e708809`, delivered through GitHub PR #6,
  and verified in merge commit `cd938e2ce0ef9e792b2979cd325e614a65d42590` on
  `origin/main`. The local smoke layer covers normal launcher startup, exact
  isolated paths, external and symlink invocation, workbench/settings/Git
  invariants, concurrent runs, and cross-platform fixture cleanup.
- Reconciliation PR #7 was merged at `bcdd81ce9e9d0a3badc21d220f98d31600167059`
  on `origin/main`; TASK-006 uses that verified branch tip as its baseline.
- `TASK-002` candidate `54ad217047eb07b75b08697129cde3c905418443`
  received local verdict `APPROVED`, was delivered through GitHub PR #2, and
  is present in merge commit `794a7c6fe09abb335fb7c14273614a796b365631` on
  `origin/main`. Native terminal mouse interaction was verified in an
  independent PTY, including bidirectional divider drag, minimum width
  behavior, and left-pane click selection without `E21`.
- `TASK-006` was locally reviewed `APPROVED` at candidate
  `08ca56ca7efcecb759412d4b6cafa60f33921d6a`, delivered through GitHub PR #8,
  and verified in merge commit `86ee75844308afbaf7e055bd86b6e5ca8b38a903` on
  `origin/main`. The derivative now has an offline deterministic
  package/install helper, local distribution and upstream sync runbooks, and
  offline package/fixture validation integrated into the test runner.

## Active blockers

- No active blocker. TASK-006 is accepted on `origin/main`; the backlog is
  empty. No hosted, production, recovery, or customer-acceptance claim is
  made.

## Next orchestration action

Await a fresh user brief for the next slice. TASK-001 through TASK-006 are all
accepted; do not invent new product scope without user direction. The local
distribution and upstream sync procedures are documented in
`docs/LOCAL_DISTRIBUTION.md` and `docs/UPSTREAM_SYNC.md` for future
maintenance.
